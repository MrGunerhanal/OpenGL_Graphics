• Coding in shaders (resources/shaders)<br>
Phong Model<br>
Blinn-Phong reflectance model<br>
Blinn-Phong spotlight model<br>
Fog effect<br>
Toon shader<br>
  
• Race Track<br>
Catmull-Rom spline (form a track)<br>
UV Mapping to apply texture<br>
  
• Camera<br>
Different angles<br>
  
• Assets<br>
